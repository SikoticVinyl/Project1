# Impact of Game Updates on Player Retention

## Project Overview

**Aim:** This project investigates the impact of major game updates on player retention and activity levels in three games: "The Isle," "ARK: Survival Evolved," and "No Man's Sky."

### Scope and Purpose

- **Data Field:** Gaming
- **Data Types:**
  - Player count data over time
  - Game update logs
  - User reviews in relation to update times

**Questions to Explore:**

1. **General Impact of Updates on Player Retention:**
   - How do major updates affect the player count in the days and weeks following the update?
   - Is there a noticeable increase or decrease in player retention immediately after an update?

2. **Frequency of Updates and Player Activity:**
   - How does the frequency of updates (e.g., monthly vs. quarterly) impact player retention and activity levels?
   - Are more frequent updates associated with higher or lower player engagement between updates?

3. **Types of Updates and Their Effectiveness:**
   - Do updates that introduce new content have a more significant impact on player retention compared to bug fixes or balance changes?
   - How do different types of updates affect long-term player engagement?

4. **Comparative Analysis Across Multiple Games:**
   - How do player retention trends following updates compare between "The Isle," "ARK: Survival Evolved," and "No Man's Sky"?
   - Are there differences in how frequent or less frequent updates affect player counts across these games?
