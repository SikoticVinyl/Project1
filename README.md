# Impact of Game Updates on Player Retention

## Project Overview
The aim of our project is to investigate the impact of major game updates on player retention and activity levels in three selected games: The Isle, ARK: Survival Evolved, and No Man's Sky. By analyzing player count data, update logs, and reviews, we aim to uncover patterns and provide insights into how different types and frequencies of updates affect player engagement.

## Scope and Purpose
### Data Field
- **Field:** Gaming

### Data Types
- **Player count data over time**
- **Game update logs**
- **User reviews in relation to update times**

### Questions to Explore
1. **General Impact of Updates on Player Retention:**
   - How do major updates affect the player count in the days and weeks following the update?
   - Is there a noticeable increase or decrease in player retention immediately after an update?

2. **Frequency of Updates and Player Activity:**
   - How does the frequency of updates (e.g., monthly vs. quarterly) impact player retention and activity levels?
   - Are more frequent updates associated with higher or lower player engagement between updates?

3. **Types of Updates and Their Effectiveness:**
   - Do updates that introduce new content have a more significant impact on player retention compared to bug fixes or balance changes?
   - How do different types of updates affect long-term player engagement?

4. **Comparative Analysis Across Multiple Games:**
   - How do player retention trends following updates compare between The Isle, ARK: Survival Evolved, and No Man's Sky?
   - Are there differences in how frequent or less frequent updates affect player counts across these games?

### Possible Data Sources
- **Steam API:** For player count data
- **Official game websites and forums:** For update logs
- **Steam reviews:** For user reviews related to update times
